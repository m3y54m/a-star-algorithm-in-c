# A* Algorithm Implementation in C


A very basic and easy to understand implementation of A* algorithm in C that was part of my "Fundamentals of Programming" course at the University of Zanjan, Fall 2012.

The code is written based on this tutorial: [Introduction to A* Pathfinding](https://www.raywenderlich.com/3016-introduction-to-a-pathfinding)

I translated this tutorial into Persian/فارسی and published it on my website (<span dir=rtl>[آشنایی با الگوریتم مسیریابی *A](https://meysamparvizi.ir/posts/a-star-pathfinding-algorithm/)</span>).
